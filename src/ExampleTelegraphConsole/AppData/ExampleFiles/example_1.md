# Title

This is the first paragraph. Lists are a great way to organize information in markdown.

## Unordered List

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

## Ordered List

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

This is the third paragraph. Images can be added to a markdown file by using an exclamation point (!) followed by the image syntax in brackets.

![Image Alt Text](image1.jpg)

You can also add a link to an image by using the same syntax, but with the image source in parentheses:

[![Linked Image Alt Text](image2.jpg)](https://example.com)
