This is the second paragraph. Tables can be created in markdown by using pipes (|) to separate cells and dashes (-) to create a header row.

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Cell 4   | Cell 5   | Cell 6   |

This is the third paragraph. Images can be added to a markdown file by using an exclamation point (!) followed by the image syntax in brackets.

![Image Alt Text](image1.jpg)

You can also add a link to an image by using the same syntax, but with the image source in parentheses:

[![Linked Image Alt Text](image2.jpg)](https://example.com)
