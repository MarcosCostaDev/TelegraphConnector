# Contributing to TelegraphConnector
We welcome contributions to TelegraphConnector! If you're interested in contributing, here are some guidelines to get you started.

## Trunk Based Development
TelegraphConnector uses Trunk Based Development as our approach to version control and code management. This means that all code is developed in a single branch, usually called main, and all changes are made in the form of small, incremental commits.

## How to Contribute
Here's how you can contribute to TelegraphConnector:

1. Fork the repository: First, fork the repository to your own GitHub account. This will create a copy of the repository that you can modify and use as you see fit.

2. Clone the repository: Next, clone the repository to your local machine. This will allow you to work on the code locally and commit your changes.

3. Create a new branch: Before you start making changes, create a new branch for your work. This will help keep your changes separate from the main branch, making it easier to review and merge your work.

4. Make your changes: Now you're ready to make your changes. Remember to keep your commits small and incremental, and include a descriptive commit message.

5. Push your changes: When you're finished making your changes, push your branch to your fork of the repository. This will make your changes available for review.

6. Create a pull request: Finally, create a pull request to submit your changes for review. In the pull request, include a description of the changes you made and any relevant information.

## Code Review
All pull requests will be reviewed and provided feedback on any issues or suggestions for improvement. Once your changes have been reviewed, we'll either merge your pull request or request additional changes.

Thank you for considering contributing to TelegraphConnector! We look forward to reviewing your changes.
